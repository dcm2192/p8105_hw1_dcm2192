This file will include answers to HW1 questions.

## Problem 1

*Load `penguins` dataset.*

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

The `penguins` dataset provides information regarding the locations,
classifications, and physical attributes of the penguins. Specifically,
it describes the `species`, `island`, `bill_length_mm`, `bill_depth_mm`,
`flipper_length_mm`, `body_mass_g`, `sex`, and `year` of each penguin.
The penguins are classified by `species` as either Adelie, Chinstrap, or
Gentoo. Each penguin comes from one of three islands from the `island`
variable: Biscoe, Dream, and Torgersen. The size of their bills,
measured in millimeters, is shown as decimals in `bill_length_mm` and
`bill_depth_mm`, respectively. The length of their flippers, measured in
millimeters, is shown as integers in `flipper_length_mm`. Their body
mass, measured in grams, is shown as integers in `body_mass_g`. Their
sex is categorized as either female or male, as shown in `sex`. The
`year` column is provided as integers, with values ranging from 2007 to
2009. The `penguins` dataset contains 344 observations and 8 variables.
The mean flipper length is 200.9152047 mm.

*Create scatterplot of flipper length and bill length, with colors
categorized by species.*

``` r
ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
           y = flipper_length_mm, 
           color = species)) + 
  geom_point()
```

    ## (`geom_point()`).

*Export scatterplot to project directory.*

``` r
ggsave("penguins_flipper_bill_plot.pdf")
```

## Problem 2

*Create data frame.*

``` r
prob2_df <- 
  tibble(
    norm_samp = rnorm(n = 10, mean = 1), 
    samp_greater_than_0 = norm_samp > 0, 
    char_vec = c("John", "Bob", "Mark", "Jesse", "Mary", "Barbie", "Molly", "Terry", "Tom", "Ralph"), 
    factor_vec = factor(c("urban", "urban", "rural", "suburban", "suburban", "urban", "rural", "urban", "rural", "urban"))
  )
```
