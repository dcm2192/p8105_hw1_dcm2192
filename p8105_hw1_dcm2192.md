## Problem 1

*Load `penguins` dataset.*

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

The `penguins` dataset provides information regarding the locations,
classifications, and physical attributes of the penguins. Specifically,
it describes the `species`, `island`, `bill_length_mm`, `bill_depth_mm`,
`flipper_length_mm`, `body_mass_g`, `sex`, and `year` of each penguin.
The penguins are classified by `species` as either Adelie, Chinstrap, or
Gentoo. Each penguin comes from one of three islands from the `island`
variable: Biscoe, Dream, and Torgersen. The size of their bills,
measured in millimeters, is shown as decimals in `bill_length_mm` and
`bill_depth_mm`, respectively. The length of their flippers, measured in
millimeters, is shown as integers in `flipper_length_mm`. Their body
mass, measured in grams, is shown as integers in `body_mass_g`. Their
sex is categorized as either female or male, as shown in `sex`. The
`year` column is provided as integers, with values ranging from 2007 to
2009. The `penguins` dataset contains 344 observations and 8 variables.
The mean flipper length is 200.9152047 mm.

*Create scatterplot of flipper length and bill length, with colors
categorized by species.*

``` r
ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
           y = flipper_length_mm, 
           color = species)) + 
  geom_point()
```

*Export scatterplot to project directory.*

``` r
ggsave("penguins_flipper_bill_plot.pdf")
```

## Problem 2

*Create data frame.*

``` r
prob2_df <- 
  tibble(
    norm_samp = rnorm(n = 10, mean = 1), 
    samp_greater_than_0 = norm_samp > 0, 
    char_vec = c("John", "Bob", "Mark", "Jesse", "Mary", "Barbie", "Molly", "Terry", "Tom", "Ralph"), 
    factor_vec = factor(c("urban", "urban", "rural", "suburban", "suburban", "urban", "rural", "urban", "rural", "urban"))
  )

prob2_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 Ã— 4
    ##    norm_samp samp_greater_than_0 char_vec factor_vec
    ##        <dbl> <lgl>               <chr>    <fct>     
    ##  1     0.121 TRUE                John     urban     
    ##  2    -0.235 FALSE               Bob      urban     
    ##  3     2.18  TRUE                Mark     rural     
    ##  4     1.70  TRUE                Jesse    suburban  
    ##  5     1.22  TRUE                Mary     suburban  
    ##  6     1.99  TRUE                Barbie   urban     
    ##  7     1.14  TRUE                Molly    rural     
    ##  8     0.403 TRUE                Terry    urban     
    ##  9     0.885 TRUE                Tom      rural     
    ## 10     1.85  TRUE                Ralph    urban

*Try to take the mean of each variable.*

``` r
mean(pull(prob2_df, norm_samp))
```

    ## [1] 1.125399

``` r
mean(pull(prob2_df, samp_greater_than_0))
```

    ## [1] 0.9

``` r
mean(pull(prob2_df, char_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(prob2_df, char_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(prob2_df, factor_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(prob2_df, factor_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

In the `prob2_df` data frame, the numeric columns `norm_samp` and
`samp_greater_than_0` are able to generate a mean, whereas the character
vector `vector` and the factor vector `factor_vec` are unable to
generate a mean. This is because R cannot calculate the average value of
non-numeric variables.

*Try to convert each variable to numeric.*

``` r
as.numeric(pull(prob2_df, n orm_samp))
as.numeric(pull(prob2_df, samp_greater_than_0))
as.numeric(pull(prob2_df, char_vec))
as.numeric(pull(prob2_df, factor_vec))
```

The `as.numeric` function converts a non-numeric variable into a numeric
variable, and it is successful in doing so for the variables
`norm_samp`, `samp_greater_than_0`, and `factor_vec` in the `prob2_df`
data frame. This is because `norm_samp` is already a numeric variable,
`samp_greater_than_0` is a logical variable that can be converted to a
binary true or false (1 or 0) value, and `factor_vec` is a factor
variable whose category can be assigned a numerical value based on the
number of levels (in this case, 3). `as.numeric` cannot be applied to
`char_vec` because this variable is non-numeric without any possible
categorization, since each string value in this column has a unique
value and cannot be reclassified like the logical and factor variables
can. This also explains why R cannot generate the mean of
`sample_greater_than_0`, `char_vec`, and `factor_vec` without first
converting them to numeric values, as doing so would allow R to use
these numbers to perform the average calculation.
